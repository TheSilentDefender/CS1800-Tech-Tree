This is a (tech tree)[https://thesilentdefender.github.io/CS1800-Tech-Tree/] of our CS1800 course. A tech tree (unfortunately it is not mathematically one) visual representation of the upgrades or knowledge you can gain within a game. Usually the player would start at the top and slowly make their way down the tree and is allowed to skip branches. This is the (source code)[https://github.com/TheSilentDefender/CS1800-Tech-Tree] of the project.
